AMS 209 - Homework 5: More Python Stuff
=========================================

In this homework we assigned to work with list and dictionaries and their respective features. Click `here <https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dongwook/wp-content/uploads/2017/ams209/lectureNote/_build/html/hw/hw5/hw5.html>`_ to see assignment. Additionally, some of the homework questions use the following file as an input: :download:`words.txt <./hw5/words.txt>`.

############################
Problem 1
############################ 

This code takes an input :download:`words.txt <./hw5/words.txt>` and then proceeds to store each word in the file into a list and as keys in a dictionary with arbitrary value.

.. literalinclude:: ./hw5/prob1/prob1.py
					:language: python
					:linenos:

############################
Problem 2
############################ 

The code for problem 2 takes the file :download:`words.txt <./hw5/words.txt>` as an input and then proceeds to count the characters found in the file and then prints the frequency.

.. literalinclude:: ./hw5/prob2/prob2.py
					:language: python
					:linenos:

############################
Problem 3
############################ 

In problem 3 we create a unit conversion calculator. We have a dictionary that is given in terms of units/meter. The user then proceeds to input a length and a desired unit system. When we have that input then the function converts the given length to meters and then finally computes the equivalent length in the other units. 

.. literalinclude:: ./hw5/prob3/prob3.py
