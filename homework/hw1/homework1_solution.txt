Question 3:

Command 'apropos' 
- searches to find installed files that correspond to the keyword.

Command 'awk'
- It can be used to find strings within a file
- Example ==> awk '/Martin/' input-file.txt
  - the slashes let awk know what pattern to look for in
  input-file.txt
- Can be used to be rearrange columns within a document.

Command 'diff'
- this command compares files line by line and prints the files differences in the file.

Command 'chmod'
- you can use this file to modify permissions on the file. What the user, members of group, and others can do.

Command 'chown'
- with this command you can change file owner and group

Command 'ln'
- this makes links between files. It kind of works like a pointer in C where rather than duplicating a variable, you can simply point an variable that already exists.

Command 'uniq'
- this command reports repeated lines in a file



Question 6:

(a) Command = sort -f roster.txt >
roster_sort_firstName.txt

(b) Command = awk '{ print $2 " " $1 " " $3 " " $4 " " $5 }' roster.txt | sort
-f > roster_sort_lastName.txt && more roster_sort_lastName.txt

(c) Command = awk '{ print $2 " " $1 " " $3 " " $4 " " $5 }' roster.txt | sort
-f > roster_sort_lastName.txt && more roster_sort_lastName.txt

(d) Number of students in class = 31; Command = wc -l roster_sort_lastName_noDuplicate.txt

(e) Command = awk '{print $1 ", " $2 " " $3 " " $4 " " $5 }' roster_sort_lastName_noDuplicate.txt > roster_sort_lastNameSpace_noDuplicate.txt && more roster_sort_lastNameSpace_noDuplicate.txt

(f) PhD students = 15; Command = grep -i 'graduate'
roster_sort_lastNameSpace_noDuplicate.txt | grep -ic 'phd'

MS Students = 14; Command = grep -i 'graduate' roster_sort_lastNameSpace_noDuplicate.txt | grep -ic 'ms'

Undergrad = 3; Command = grep -ic 'ba' roster_sort_lastNameSpace_noDuplicate.txt

(g) SCAMMS Students = 5; Command = grep -i 'scamms' roster_sort_lastNameSpace_noDuplicate.txt | sort -r > roster_reverse_sort_scammsStudents.txt

Question 7:
