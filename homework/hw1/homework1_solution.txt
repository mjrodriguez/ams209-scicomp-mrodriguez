Question 3:

Command 'apropos' 
- searches to find installed files that correspond to the keyword.

Command 'awk'
- It can be used to find strings within a file
- Example ==> awk '/Martin/' input-file.txt
  - the slashes let awk know what pattern to look for in input-file.txt

Command 'diff'
- this command compares files line by line and prints the files differences in the file.

Command 'chmod'
- you can use this file to modify permissions on the file. What the user, members of group, and others can do.

Command 'chown'
- with this command you can change file owner and group

Command 'ln'
- this makes links between files. It kind of works like a pointer in C where rather than duplicating a variable, you can simply point an variable that already exists.

Command 'uniq'
- this command reports repeated lines in a file
